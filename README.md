# VMEXT2: A Visual Wikidata aware Content MathML Editor

VMEXT is a Visualization of the content MathML EXpression Tree.
In VMEXT2, we add the functionality to edit the content MathML expressions visually.
In addition to the standard OpenMath based content dictionaries, Wikidata items can be used as content symbols.
Moreover, we added a MathML source code editor to allow for seamless integration of a visual and nonvisual editing workflow.
We regard VMEXT2 as a step forward to a semantic formula editor for Wikipedia.
